## Open Source Contribution

I am passionate about contributing to open source projects in my free time. All projects from 2021 are open-sourced on my GitHub. Recently, I started developing libraries for sensor integration with Arduino IDE. I have created two libraries so far, and both of them are added to the official Arduino IDE.

Arduino Sensor Library List:
1. **DHT11 Arduino Library**: A simple and efficient library for reading temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor without dependencies.
2. **SimpleUltrasonic Arduino Library**: A simple and efficient library for calculating distance data from the HC-SR04 sensor without dependencies.

I have also created some tutorials:
1. **How to install graphics.h in Ubuntu**
2. **Setting up WSL2 for C/C++/OpenGL Development** - Step-by-step instructions

## Gaming Experience

As a gamer, I have set up Minecraft and Rust servers to play with my friends. Through this experience, I have gained knowledge about automation using shell and batch scripts. I have also learned about AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure for managing virtual machines, networking, and SSH-based terminal control.

**Minecraft:**
- Developed a Vanilla Minecraft Server Management script.
- Implemented auto backup on server stop, auto restart on server crash, update from Mojang website, and backup/start functions.
- Created a texture pack to provide basic anti-cheating measures against X-ray exploits.
- Ran the server for my friends from 2019 to 2021.
- Explored Minecraft texture pack design and utilized Nvidia AI upscaling with CUDA.

**Rust:**
- Founded and administered a Rust server from 2020 to 2022.
- Configured plugins, handled server moderation, and maintained server performance.
- Implemented automated backup on server stop and auto-restart on server crash.
- Utilized various Rust server hosting platforms and gained experience in managing game servers.
